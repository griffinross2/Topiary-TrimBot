# Topiary TrimBot
Have you ever seen a sculpture made not of stone or ice, but a living, growing plant? Topiaries are a common feature of lavish gardens staffed by professional topiarists, but are often out-of-reach of the amateur gardener or homeowner. Enter the Topiary TrimBot, an automated platform for creating your own custom topiaries. A bush is placed in the machine and then the user inputs their desired 3D shape. The TrimBot will then automatically detect the current plant shape, generate a plan for trimming it into the desired shape, and perform the required cutting. The user can then practice maintaining and refining the shape via hand-trimming, helping them to learn the art of topiary!

This is the home of the Purdue University ECE 49595SD senior design group E11 in Fall 2025.
